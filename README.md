# OneAPI_SYKL
 
This repository contains all the information studied and created during the [OneAPI/SYCL](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/) hackathon. SYCL is a higher-level programming model for heterogeneous computing that builds on top of standard C++. It allows developers to write code in a familiar C++ syntax and use modern C++ features such as templates and lambdas, while still leveraging the performance benefits of heterogeneous computing.
